Problem   Set   1
Due:    15   August   2024
1 Solow Model (10 points) Instructions.      Use   Table   1.11   from   Stats   NZ   National   Accounts   (Accumulation   Accounts)   to   find   the   closing   balance   for    “total    non-financial   assets”   for   the   year   ending   31   March   2018   (i.e., t=2018).    Let this   be your   baseline   aggregate   capital   stock.    Assume   production   is   governed   by   a   Cobb-Douglas   function   using   capital   and   labour   as   inputs.   You   are   going   to   workout   the   per   capita   capital   stock   and   output   level   in   steady   state,   as   well   as   the   first   year in   which   it   is   obtained.    Start   by “calibrating”   (assigning   a   real-life   value   to)   the   following parameters:
δ,s,n,α,   L
.
1.    Provide   an   academic   reference   and   short   written   motivation   for   the   source   of   your   choice   for   each   parameter.      Example:      I   set   the   rate of   depreciation   to 6.6% drawing   on   comparable estimates   for   the United States,   published   by   the   Bureau    of   Economic   Analysis   (BEA,   2023)   .    I   compute   the   depreciation   measure   by   taking   the   depreciation   estimate   for fixed   assets    and   consumer   durable   goods   in   2018, $5,238.5, and   dividing   it by the estimate for average capital stock over the 2017-2018    period, (84,   439.2   +   74, 284.82)/2   =   $79,   362.   I consider the    U.S.   estimate   to   be   comparable   to   New   Zealand   because...).                [3   points]

3.   Derive mathematically using your calibrations   (a) the per capita代 写Econ 311: Advanced Macroeconomics Problem Set 1 2024Matlab
代做程序编程语言 capital stock in steady   state;   (b)   output   per   capita   in   steady   state;   (c)   your   forecast   for   the   capital   stock   in 2021.                                               [3   points]4.    How   does   this   forecast   compare   with   the   actual   Stats   NZ   estimate   for   2021?    [1   point]
5.    Use   Excel,   R,   Matlab   or   equivalent   to   plot   the   evolution   of   capital   from   2018-2100   using   your   calibrations.   Provide   a   labelled   figure   of your   plot.                                                                      [2   points]
2          Intertemporal Optimisation (5 points) 
Suppose   a   household   solves   the   following   two-period   consumption-savings   problem:
c1(m) u(c1   ) + βu(c2   )
                                                                   s.t.                                                                                                                                                            (1)
a   =   a0   + y1   − c1
c2      = y2   + (1 + r)a
where   u(ct   ) = ln(ct   )   for   t   =   1,   2.1.    Set   up   a   Lagrangian   for   the   household.                                                                                                                                                                                              [1   point]
2.    Solve   for   the   household’s   choice   of   c1   ,   c2       and   a   in   closed   form,   providing   a   written interpretation   of each   step.       [3   points]3.   What   happens   to   savings,   a,   if y2    increases?
